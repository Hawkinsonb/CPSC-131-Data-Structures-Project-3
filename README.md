Brandon Hawknson b.hawkinson245@csu.fullerton.edu

Faraj Haddad fhaddad@csu.fullerton.edu

## You need to answer the following question. 
Two binary search trees contains exactly the same number of entries of student information but in different orders.
Do they give the same performance in terms of key searching or firstname searching? if not, why? use the data you obtain from you code to 
explain your answer. 

No, they do not give the same performance results. The key searching proved to be much faster verses the firstname searching. In our case Faraj took 58 steps for firstname search and 7 for key search. Brandon took 27 step for firstname search and 7 for key search.
